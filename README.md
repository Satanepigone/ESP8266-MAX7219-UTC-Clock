# ESP8266-MAX7219-UTC-Clock

## Background
A few days ago, I was seraching the Internet/Online Shops for a simple, accurate desktop clock with good looking.
But, these clocks are all not very satisfying nor meet my demand:
Radio Wave/GPS/NTP synchronized, accurate, displaying the seconds, be able to selecet and switch between time zones, auto DST, (and good looking).
Thus I decide to DIY it.

This project is based on [max7219_matrix_clock3](https://github.com/tehniq3/max7219_matrix_clock3) by [Nicu FLORICA (niq_ro)](https://github.com/tehniq3).
